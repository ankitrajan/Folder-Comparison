Reference structure :
( ( . ( . . ) . ) )

Predicted structure 1 :
. . . . . . . . . .

Predicted structure 2 :
( ( . ) . . ( . ) )

Using our definitions of each category we get the following values for TP, FN, TN and FP respectively :

Predicted structure 1 : 
TP = 0 
FN = 3 
TN = 4  
FP = 0

Predicted structure 2 : 
TP = 1 
FN = 2 
TN = 4
FP = 2

As it could be seen, TP + FN is same for both predictions, whereas TN + FP is not.
